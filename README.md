# Lab #1

## Aim

To become more familiar with Git, GitHub and Python and the development environment.

## Outline

In the Python programming language, you are expected to design and implement a simple script that performs actions as defined be the requirements below. These actions or functions must be added to your code one after the other separated by a commit to the repository hosted on GitHub. 

Addition of any further functionality is up to you but the following functions must be included:

1. Write a function, `parallel()`, that, when called, prints the effective resistance of a network of resistors connected in parallel. The function should be able to accept a single **list** as argument.
   
2. Write a function, `potential_divider()`, that takes **two values** as argument: a number that represents a voltage supply value, and a **list** of numbers that represent resistance values of resistors connected in series. The function should output the voltage drop across each resistor in your resistor list. The function should be able to accept a **list** of any length.
   
    eg. 
    
    ```python
    > potential_divider(9, [3000, 1000])
    > "6.75v"
    > "2.25v"
    ```
    
    (5 marks)
    
3. Write a function, `temperature_check()`, that accepts a single number, a patient's body temperature, and a single character, the unit of temperature. The function should output whether the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal body temperature based on the number passed to the function. 
    
The second value passed as argument should tell the function whether the condition should calculated in degrees celcius or degrees fahrenheit.

An appropriate message should be written to the screen with the result.
